## Project summary

Library of Alexandria (LoA) generates comprehensive, AI-powered documentation for protocols, directly addressing the critical bottleneck of documentation creation and maintenance. We've already proven the concept by creating documentation for aave, and we're requesting funding for AI infrastructure to create in-depth protocol analysis, function tracing, and governance documentation for the gno.land ecosystem.

LoA has three parts - General function documentation, technical documentation, and a governance analysis section. Gno.land will get that same support.

Our system will automatically generate detailed technical breakdowns, trace functions across multiple contracts, and provide governance analysis - similar to our existing work but tailored to gno.land's unique architecture. This documentation will dramatically improve developer understanding of complex application interactions and protocol design decisions, and boosting protocol transparency and improving signal and cutting through the noise and fragmentation in Web3.

By automating documentation creation, our solution will free up valuable engineering and DevRel resources that would normally be spent writing and maintaining documentation, allowing the gno.land team to focus on core development and accelerate go-to-market timelines.

### Goals and deliverables

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Months 1-3)
    
    - 4 Mac Ultra Studios for AI processing
    - Server infrastructure for hosting
    - AI model training and fine-tuning
2. **Technical Documentation** (Months 4-6)
    
    - Protocol deep dives with contract interaction flows
    - Function tracing across multiple contracts
    - Parameter impact analysis
    - Contract state management documentation
    - Protocol function documentation
3. **Developer Tools** (Months 7-10)
    
    - Interactive protocol explorer with function call tracing
    - Auto-updating documentation linked to contract changes and public updates
    - Governance proposal analysis and historical context
    - Cross protocol liquidation risk tracker
    - Technical risk assessment of protocol interactions

### Impact on gno.land's developer ecosystem

- **Developer Resource Optimization**: Frees up valuable engineering and DevRel time normally spent writing documentation, allowing for accelerated development and faster go-to-market
- **Deeper Protocol Understanding**: Comprehensive documentation of how contracts interact and function internals work
- **Improved Development Efficiency**: Detailed function tracing reducing time spent navigating complex codebases
- **Better Governance Participation**: Analysis of proposals with historical context and technical implications
- **Accelerated Protocol Integration**: Clear documentation of integration patterns and cross-contract interactions

## Contributions or related work

Our existing project [LoA.Wiki](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Floa.wiki%2F) serves as a direct proof of concept and demonstration of our capabilities in this specific domain. It showcases our ability to create comprehensive, AI-powered documentation for complex blockchain protocols, with deep dives into protocol mechanics and code walkthroughs.

## Why are you and your team well-suited for this project?

Meet the team:

**BowTiedBernard**: Creator of LoA.Wiki with Web3 product experience and AI agent expertise.

**HomicidialChicken**: 2x founder, Solidity and data engineer, technical lead on LoA.Wiki.

We've already demonstrated our ability to create high-quality, AI-powered documentation through LoA.Wiki, which serves as both proof of concept and foundation for this project.

There's potential for an addition of up to two more team members for AI agent development and refinement.
